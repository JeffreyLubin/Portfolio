                        <div id="about_text_content">
                            <p>I was born and raised in San Antonio, TX, and still reside there to this very day. 
                                I am looking to make a really big move in the next 6mos-1yr, but for now this city is what I call home. 
                                I'm a musician as you might be able to tell from the slideshow above, but the main reason I'm making this website is 
                                to showcase my web development skills. I've been interested in web development since I was in middle school, and I took 
                                specialized classes in high school that taught me how to use HTML & CSS effectively. I lost my touch with web design after I 
                                graduated high school in 2014, because I had plans to get a degree in computer engineering. My plans shattered though, as I decided 
                                that I wanted to live my dreams, and I started doing music full time, putting off school to pursue my passion. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Every single year since I graduated, I did dabble in web development. I would get heavily interested in the topic, read endless books and 
                                tutorials, but I wasn't consistent, and I wasn't disciplined. This back and forth, maybe I will maybe I won't, went on for about 5 1/2 years.
                                I knew I wanted to be a web developer, but I didn't think I had the skills, so in mid 2019, I decided to finally just jump in, and I started up my studying again. 
                                This time around though, I decided to put myself through specialized training through a company called NuCamp. I figured if I paid to sign up for classes, I'd be more 
                                motivated, but by this time around, my self-motivation for web development is constantly being raised. Since my commitment to become a bona fide web developer, 
                                I've started courses to learn PHP, and JavaScript, and I've decided to actually sit down and code a website for myself, to portray to the public, in hopes of finding 
                                work doing something I really and truly love doing. This website is mainly just a way for me to prove to myself that I CAN build a functioning website, but also 
                                to post my latest projects, and offer various services. Feel free to browse around and see what I'm all about! If you like what you see and want to talk business, or if you just want to get in touch to say hi,
                                just go to my contact page, or email me directly @ Jeffy.Lubin@gmail.com, and I'll make sure to get back to you!

                                            left side has one extra face. It's your job to click on the face that is extra, prompting the game to reset with 5 more faces,
                                            progressively getting more difficult. This project taught me a lot about javascript loop functions, and creating/erasing html functions using Javascript to alter the page. The lessons I learned in this concept are used in this website under the "Music Projects" 
                                            tab, and I'm sure I'll be using these very concepts for years on end.

                                            This project was provided by NuCamp. This one I had a harder time figuring out than all the others on this list. 
                                            Essentially, the website asks you to guess what color it picked, you guess until you get it right, then it tells you how many 
                                            guesses you had, and changes the background color accordingly. This was my very first introduction to changing styles in Javascript, 
                                            but that wasn't what was throwing me off. What was getting me stuck was when the user enters a number that's not in the list, it should
                                            prompt an error message, and I was having a hard time figuring out how to get the function to take a string, and compare it with an array of 
                                            pre-determined colors, to check if it's at least in that color list. I eventually figured it out using the indexOf() function, and now that I know 
                                            how to do that, I'll imagine this project will have taught me a valuable lesson in JavaScript.

                                            This one can only be played in your console at the moment, so if you don't know how to do that and you want to try 
                                            out the game, open Google Chrome, Right click on the page, click on Inspect, find the button that says console, then type in "game();". 
                                            This will get a game of rock paper scissors going, and it's you against the computer. The computers response is completely randomized so, 
                                            just like in real life, you never know what it will do. The game goes on for a total of five rounds, and whoever has the most points at the end wins. 
                                            Simple. Fair. This challenge came from The Odin Project, and it gave me a lot of insight in handling for loops, and if conditionals. Another concept that I'll need 
                                            a full grasp on in order to great things using JavaScript.<br><br><br>

                                            This practice came courtesy of NuCamp. All this one does is it starts a for loop, and in that foor loop, it generates a random color 
                                            and creates a new div. The div will keep gradually changing in heights and placement on the screen until the loop ends. In order to get, what I like to call, 
                                            the "rave" effect, a piece of HTML meta code (http-equiv="refresh"), and this will refresh the page every few seconds. I can not imagine a time where I will ever need 
                                            to use that code outside of a fun project, but it's good to know that it's available if needed. This project taught me an endless amount of information about DOM manipulation, 
                                            and how to create new DOM with JavaScript, and edit their styles in the process.
